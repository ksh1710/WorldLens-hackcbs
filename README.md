# Project WorldLens 

Worldlens collaboratively craft immersive virtual experiences of popular tourist destinations in partnership with the Ministry of Tourism, making them accessible to individuals facing physical limitations due to factors such as aging, disabilities, time constraints, and more 
## How do we solve it 
We provide immersive Virtual Environments of Tourist sites that hold cultural importance in collaboration with the ministries of state and their tourism department. People who face difficulties in travelling to the actual sites can book tickets, hop on their VR headsets and, from the comfort of their homes, have a fulfilling experience

We utilized the following software to give our vision a solid skeleton
* Unity - We utilize Unityâ€™s 3D environment-building tools to create an immersive virtual environment 
* Taipy - We utilize this Python framework to create our Web frame (frontend and backend) for booking tickets  
* Github - Our project is stored in the GitHub repository using GitHub LFS extensions due to file sizes being too large
*Blender - We used blender for creating 3D models and environment.
